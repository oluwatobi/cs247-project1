Q1. Done

Interesting things we did: 
	- Changes the loss function
	-Switched the batch size from 1 to 17
	-changed the optimizer from 0.1 to 0.5 and we didnt notice much difference. 	But upon changing the value in the GradientDescentoptimizer to point 0.01, 		the learning happened at a slower rate.
